# rabidroid
**Engine**: Unity

**Language**: C#

**Scope**: Solo project
[Note: this is an old project. I would make things much differently today. I still like the concept and I'd probably go back to this and refactor the entire remote controlling system].

**Game Concept**: The Player must fight enemies in an open environment with the help of robot units RabiDroids. The Player can switch the RabiDroid’s attitude towards Enemies between Peaceful and Aggressive.

**Prototype takeaways**:
Confirm the solidity of the paper design
Balance the maximum number of RabiDroid units
Check the accessibility of “remote control” mechanic  

**Programming Tasks**:

<li>Rabidroids AI (using Navmesh Agents)</li>
<li>Enemy AI (using Navmesh Agents)</li>
